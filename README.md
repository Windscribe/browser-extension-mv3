Still not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.

Browse Privately
-------------------------
Governments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.

Advanced Privacy Features
-------------------------
Windscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:


* Ad Crusher - Ads, trackers, malware follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy/security. Windscribe will block all this crap.

* Tracker Eradicator - Strips query parameters from pages’ URLs used to track you.

* Social Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their tracking widgets and buttons.

* Cookie Go Away - Blocks annoying "We use cookies" banners on all websites

* Whitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.

* Notification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.

* WebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.

* Geolocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.

* Timezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.

* User Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting

* Language Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.

* Worker Block - web workers from running in the background and collecting data.

* Ad Privacy - Disable ad topics, site-suggested ads, and ad measurement features enabled in Chrome. 

Unlock content
--------------------------
Windscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 62 different countries.

No identifying logs
-------------------------
Your privacy is a right. We don’t track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone. We don’t keep logs that can deanonymize you.

Go beyond basic protection
-------------------------
For comprehensive privacy protection even outside of the browser, use our desktop VPN applications (they’re also free). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Did we mention mobile? Yeah, there's mobile apps too.
